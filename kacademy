    <h1>What went well...</h1>
    <p>I got learn much more about coding. I had very little experience in coding, but taking that class taught me a few things.</p>
    <p>I learnt how to debug and work by myself on coding, teaching myself several other languages as well.</p>

    <h1>What didn't go well...</h1>
    <p>It took a lot of my time this semester, which is something that I didn't expect. Instead of writing a college application, I would just be working on finising the homework due the next day for this class. I liked doing the work but I think it would have been better if I had more time for my college applications and other homework.</p>

    <h1>What went well...</h1>
    <p>Like I said in first place, I learnt much more about coding. Everything that I was taught in that class was helpful.</p>
